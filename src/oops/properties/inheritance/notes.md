### Inheritence Notes

```
  //Box bt=new BoxWeight(2,3,4,6);
    //    System.out.println(bt.w);
//        System.out.println(bt.weight);  gives an error
         


```
It is the type of reference variable and not the object that determines what members can be accessed.

```
BoxWeight bt=new Box(2,3,4);
Throws an error
```
Here the object is of type PARENT. So BoxWeight ref does not know about it. 
So we cant have a child ref and a parent object

---
## Object class

All the classes are subclasses of the Object class. So `Object()` is the superclass all the classes.
---

To explicitly access the property of a parent class we can use `super.property` to do so. 
Like `super.weight` if there is a field weight in the definition of the parent class. 

```
BoxWeight(BoxWeight other){
super(other);
this.weight=other.weight;
}
```
It will call the constructor of 
```
Box(Box other){
this.h=other.h;
this.l=other.l;
this.w=other.w;
}

```
But as we can we see `Box` constructor has reference to a Box type object, and `BoxWeight` constructor is referencing to a BoxWeight type object.
So it basically like
```
Box bt=new BoxWeight(2,3,4,6);
```

`bt` can access only the w,l,h properties and not the weight property.
