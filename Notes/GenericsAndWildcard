# Difference between T extends Number & ? extends Number

###  T extends Number
1. T represents a type parameter that extends the Number class. It's used in generic class or method declarations to indicate that the type T should be a subclass of Number.
2. When you declare a class or method with T extends Number, it means that the type T can be any specific class that is a subclass of Number. For instance, Integer, Double, Float, etc., can be used as T.
3. It allows for more specific type handling and operations because within the class or method, you can use methods and properties of the Number class on objects of type T.


### ? extends Number:

1. This is a wildcard type that represents an unknown subtype of Number. It's used mainly when you want to work with a collection or method that deals with an unknown type that extends Number.
2. The ? extends Number wildcard is more flexible than using a specific type parameter (T). It allows you to work with any subclass of Number without specifying which one.
