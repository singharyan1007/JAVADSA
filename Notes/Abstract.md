# Abstract Classes

### Properties
1. Cannot create the objects of abstract classes.
2. Cannot make static methods as abstract, because the abstract methods can be overridden, and static methods cant be overridden
3. `final` and `static` dont go together

# Interfaces

**Tell what the classes can do but not how to do.**
