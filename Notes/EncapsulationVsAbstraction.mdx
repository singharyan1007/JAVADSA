### Abstraction Vs Encapsulation

| Feature                | Encapsulation                 | Abstraction                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Bundling data and methods     | Hides unnecessary details     |
| **Scope**              | At the implementation level   | At the design level           |
| **Purpose**            | Modular code organization     | Managing complexity in design |
| **Implementation**     | Using access modifiers        | Using abstract classes and interfaces        |
| **Example**            | Class with private variables  | Abstract class with interfaces|
| **Focus**              | Implementation details        | Essential system features     |
| **Benefits**           | Code organization, security   | Simplified design, modularity |
| **Usage**              | Within a class or object      | Throughout the design         |
